Find a bug? Have a feature request? Please [create an Issue]({%= bugs.url %}).

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt][], and build the documentation with [grunt-readme](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-readme).

Pull requests are also encouraged, and if you find this project useful please consider "starring" it to show your support! Thanks!
