> Boilerplate for [Assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble)

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/assemble/boilerplate/issues) if you find a bug or have a feature request.

## Getting Started

**1. Download the project**

Install the project locally using one of the following options:

* Using git: `git clone git://github.com/assemble/boilerplate.git`
* [Download the project](https://github.com/assemble/boilerplate/archive/master.zip)

Next, to optionally install [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) using [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), simply run

```bash
bower install
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

Run `npm i` to install dependencies.

**3. Build**

If everything installed correctly, running `grunt` in the command line should successfully build the project to the `./_gh_pages` directory inside the project.

**4. Remove "first run" Targets**

Inside the [Gruntfile](./Gruntfile.js) you will find a few targets that should be removed after the first run. These are labeled accordingly.
