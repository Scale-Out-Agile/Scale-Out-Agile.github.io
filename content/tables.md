## Tables
Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.


``` markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

And this HTML:

``` html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>engine</td>
    <td>engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ext</td>
    <td>extension to be used for dest files.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

### Right aligned text

Adding a colon on the right side of the dashes below any heading will right align text for that column.
